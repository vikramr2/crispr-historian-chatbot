# CRISPR Historian ChatBot

This is a specialized chatbot meant to give more in depth answers on the history of CRISPR as a field.

## Features

From the original repository
- **Interactive UI**: Utilize Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface.
- **Local Model Execution**: Run your Ollama models locally without the need for external APIs.
- **Real-time Responses**: Get real-time responses from your models directly in the UI.

Updates
- **Prompt Chaining**: Uses langchain to decompose questions into specialized subquestions to improve answer quality
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This chatbot retrieves from a database of 976 pdfs of research articles on CRISPR

## Installation

Before running the app, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and install the required packages using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikramr2/crispr_historian_chatbot.git
```

```bash
cd crispr_historian_chatbot
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run chat.py --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.port=8501
```

Navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit in your browser to interact with the app.

### Installing Ollama without root
```bash
# Create a local bin directory
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin

# Download the binary
curl -L https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/latest/download/ollama-linux-amd64 -o $HOME/.local/bin/ollama

# Make it executable
chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/ollama

# Add to PATH (add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```


### Models I used
Personally, I found that `Gemma3` as a generator, and `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` worked very well

To install `Gemma3` via ollama:
- First, run `./ollama serve`
- In another terminal window, run `./ollama pull gemma3:latest`

`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` will automatically be installed from HuggingFace when this app is run for the first time.
